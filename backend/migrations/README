# Database Migrations

This directory contains Alembic migrations for the trading simulator database.

## Common Commands

### Create a new migration (after changing models)
```bash
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Description of changes"
```
This command detects changes in your SQLModel models (located in `app/models/`) and generates a migration file.

### Apply migrations to database
```bash
alembic upgrade head
```
This applies all pending migrations to bring your database up to date.

### Check current migration status
```bash
alembic current
```

### Rollback one migration
```bash
alembic downgrade -1
```

## Workflow

1. Make changes to your models in `app/models/`
2. Generate migration: `alembic revision --autogenerate -m "your message"`
3. Review the generated migration file in `migrations/versions/`
4. Apply migration: `alembic upgrade head`

## Notes

- Always review auto-generated migrations before applying them
- Database connection configured in `app/core/config.py` (via DATABASE_URL)
- All models use UUID7 for primary keys
